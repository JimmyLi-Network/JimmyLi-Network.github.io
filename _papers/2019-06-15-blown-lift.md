abstract: "This paper presents wind tunnel measurements of blown ﬂapped airfoil performance forapplication to distributed electric propulsion STOL aircraft. The 2D airfoil wind tunnelmodel features a simple slotted ﬂap, and closely-spaced spanwise-distributed propellers drivenby electric motors. Measurements of lift, pitching moment and net streamwise force (dragminus thrust) were made over a range of propeller RPM, angle of attack and ﬂap angle. Liftcoeﬃcients up to 9 were measured for practical blowing levels. High lift was also measuredwith net streamwise force close to zero, which suggests that the use of blown lift during landingis practical."
