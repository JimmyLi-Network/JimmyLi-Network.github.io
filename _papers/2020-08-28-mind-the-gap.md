abstract: "Robust, low-cost solutions are needed to maintain social distancing guidelines during the
COVID-19 pandemic. We establish a method to measure the distance between multiple
phones across a large number of closely spaced smartphones with a median absolute error of
8.5 cm. The application works in real-time, using Time of Flight of near-ultrasound signals,
providing alerts with sufficient responsiveness to be useful for distancing while devices are
in users pockets and they are moving at walking speed. The approach is decentralized,
requires no additional hardware, and can operate in the background without an internet
connection. We have no device specific requirements nor need any manual calibration or
device synchronization. It has been tested with over 20 different phones models, from both
the Android and iOS systems in the past 5 years. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first successful such implementation, and has 25000 users at time of publishing."
