  Many types of human activities involve interaction with passive objects. Thus, 
  by wirelessly sensing human interaction with them, one can infer activities at a 
  fine resolution, enabling a new wave of ubiquitous computing applications. In 
  this paper, we propose LiveTag to achieve this vision. LiveTag is a fully passive, 
  thin metal tag that can be printed on paper-like substrates and attached to objects. 
  It has no batteries, silicon chips, or discrete electronic components. But when 
  touched by fingers, it disturbs the ambient WiFi channel in a deterministic way. 
  Multiple metallic structures can be printed on the same tag to create unique touch 
  points. Further, LiveTag incorporates customized multi-antenna beamforming 
  algorithms that allow WiFi receivers to sense the tag and discriminate the touch 
  events amid multipath reflections/interferences. Our prototypes of LiveTag have 
  verified its feasibility and performance. We have further applied LiveTag to 
  real-world usage scenarios to showcase its effectiveness in sensing human-object 
  interaction.
