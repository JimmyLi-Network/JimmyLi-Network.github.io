# jemdoc: menu{MENU}{jemdocMathJaxMaterialize.html}
= Jemdoc MathJax Materialize

This website was created using a modified version of jemdoc+mathJax

In particular, the styling has been modified to use MaterializeCSS instead of tables and raw CSS. This allows us to easily extend and use more features from Materialize. 

Overall, I feel its just a neater version of Jemdoc (although kudos to Jacob Mattingley for good design taste) and uses newer standards of webdesign. 

The main difference is that I have remove the big table wrapping the sidebar and the content, and instead defined the layout as two side-by-side columns.
The columns are responsive, and thus look reasonable on small screens. Todo: collapse side bar to hamburger menu on small screens.

== Whats New?

 - Removed table structure, introduced Materialize columns (allows for responsive website with clean theme)
 - Easier MakeFile and deploy to Github Pages


Neither of these changes should break anything in your jemdoc + mathjax websites.
It simply allows for easier extension.

=== Dependencies
Jemdoc + MathJax requires Python 2 or 3. I have only tested Python 3.8

To check links, you will need [https://github.com/bartdag/pylinkvalidator +pylinkvalidator+]
in your local environment.

MaterializeCSS is used, but is grabbed using the CDN so no efforts from your end are required.

== Folder Structure

A very simple folder structure is used.

~~~
{}{shell}
root/
  | - src/
      | - contains all the *.jemdoc files, MENU file and mysite.conf
      | - assets/
            | - contains all the assets (pictures, pdfs, codefiles etc) that you want copied over to the distrubution. The internal folder structure is preserved.
  | - jemdoc
  | - jemdoc.css
  | - Makefile
  | - deploy.sh
~~~

== Making and Deploying

You can use the commands that jemdoc documentation suggests, but I find it much easier to use my Make commands.

If youre using a virtual environment, make it active before running any of these commands. 

Run these from the root folder

~~~
{}{shell}
make             # build the website
make build       # build the website
make clean       # clean the distribution folder  
make serve       # serve the website to localhost:8080 using python
make check       # check all links (need to serve first, and needs pylinkvalidator)
./deploy.sh      # deploy the website to Github Pages (check settings first!)
~~~

Check the MakeFile to change the settings. 

Building: it takes all the jemdoc files in +src/+ and builds them to +html/+ and copies all files from +src/assets/+ to +html/assets/+ without modification.

Deploying: it cleans, builds, and then sends the +html/+ folder to the +gh-pages+ branch. 

== Documentation
The original documentation is still the key behind everything!

== Why is the Github History so messed up.

Cause I suck at github.

I accidentally deployed the website to master, which delected all the src files, and I couldn't recover it neatly. Oh well. 

== Disclaimer
There is no guarantee that stuff doesnt break in the future /isnt broken already. 
I'll be keeping this updated for my website, but I provide no guarantees beyond that. If you spot something that needs fixing let me know!
