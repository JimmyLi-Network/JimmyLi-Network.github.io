abstract: "This paper introduces the notion of an Input
Constrained Control Barrier Function (ICCBF), as a method to
synthesize safety-critical controllers for nonlinear control-affine
systems with input constraints. The method identifies a subset
of the safe set of states, and constructs a controller to render the
subset forward invariant. The feedback controller is represented
as the solution to a quadratic program, which can be solved
efficiently for real-time implementation. Furthermore, we show
that ICCBFs are a generalization of Higher Order Control
Barrier Functions, and thus are applicable to systems of non-
uniform relative degree. Simulation results are presented for the
adaptive cruise control problem, and a spacecraft rendezvous
problem."
